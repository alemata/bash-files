Instalation
===========

Backup your old files such as `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`

Clone this repository into your home folder

    `git clone git://github.com/eMancu/bash-files.git ~/.bash`

Replace your old `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` content with

    `source ~/.bash/profile`

Or just add that line to your `/etc/bashrc` file.
